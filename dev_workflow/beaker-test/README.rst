Run Beaker's Integration Tests in a Docker container
====================================================

This may be relevant to you if you are working on (or are looking to
start working on) `beaker's
<https://beaker-project.org/dev/guide/writing-a-patch.html>`__ code.

Using it
--------

Two docker images based off Fedora 21
(``beakerproject/beaker-development-fedora-21``) and CentOS 6.6
(``beakerproject/beaker-development-centos-6``) are available from the
`docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/u/beakerproject/>`__.

To run the tests on Fedora 21::

    cd Fedora21
    ./run_tests.sh /path/to/beaker bkr.inttest.client.test_job_logs

To run the tests on CentOS 6::

    cd CentOS6
    ./run_tests.sh /path/to/beaker bkr.inttest.client.test_job_logs


If the second argument is not specified, the entire test suite is run.

The tests should start running after mariadb server has been
configured and started. We do no use a persistent data volume for the
data because we want multiple container instances running simultaneously
without interfering with each other.

Once the tests have completed running, you will back to your host::
    ..
    ..
    141224 19:55:32 mysqld_safe Logging to '/var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log'.
    141224 19:55:32 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql
    mysqld is alive
    + env BEAKER_CONFIG_FILE=server-test.cfg PYTHONPATH=../Common:../Server:../LabController/src:../Client/src:../IntegrationTests/src python -c '__requires__ = ["Cherry    Py < 3.0"]; import pkg_resources; from nose.core import main; main()' bkr.inttest.client.test_job_logs
  
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 9 tests in 251.235s

    OK

 
The local copy of your beaker is now in the docker image, you
can continue working on your host's working copy making other changes,
running other tests, etc.

Use cases
---------

- Work on the beaker code base, running different tests simultaneously
- Run tests on different distros

Notes
-----

The ``run_tests.sh`` creates a temporary sub-directory of the form
``beaker-in-dockerXX`` from the directory you invoked the
``run_tests.sh`` script from. It is not cleaned up after the test run is
complete. The container executing the tests (named as
``beaker-tests-run-xx``) are also not cleaned up.
